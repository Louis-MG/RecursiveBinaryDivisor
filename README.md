Problem, 26/05/2021 : 

the code goes through several iterations, creating each time a big and a asmall cluster. The small one is not subdivised, while the big one is. At cluster .1.1.1.1, the cluster is subdivised in 
1 cluster at epsilon equals 0.85. The programm does not go in the loop to print anything.
